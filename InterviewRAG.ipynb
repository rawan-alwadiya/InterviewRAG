    "# **InterviewRAG: A Context-Aware Interview Preparation Assistant**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Project Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "**InterviewRAG** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant designed to help users prepare for job interviews by asking and answering questions based on **uploaded interview preparation PDFs**. It provides conversational, context-grounded answers powered entirely by **local open-source models**, offering both **privacy** and **zero API cost**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assistant expands vague questions, retrieves the most relevant context, and generates helpful answers using an instruction-tuned LLM—all while tracking the conversation to enhance memory and flow. It's ideal for students, job seekers, or professionals looking to practice or refine their interview readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on Output Visibility**\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Some output cells have been intentionally cleared to avoid rendering issues across platforms such as **Kaggle** and **GitHub**.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This includes:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Model pipeline and LLM initialization \n",
    "> - Embedding generation and vectorstore creation\n",
    "> \n",
    "> All code executes correctly, and full results are reproducible in local or Colab environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload an interview preparation PDF and split it into semantic chunks.  \n",
    "- Create a persistent vectorstore for fast semantic retrieval.  \n",
    "- Automatically rewrite user questions for better relevance.  \n",
    "- Return answers grounded **only** in the PDF content using a custom prompt.  \n",
    "- Maintain short-term conversation memory using a buffer.  \n",
    "- Operate fully offline using local models for both LLM and embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Core Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Loader**: `PyPDFLoader` for parsing interview preparation PDFs.  \n",
    "- **Text Chunking**: `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to break content into useful segments.  \n",
    "- **Embeddings**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` for fast vector search.  \n",
    "- **Vector Store**: `Chroma` for storing and retrieving document chunks efficiently.  \n",
    "- **LLM (Answering + Query Expansion)**: `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` for answering and refining questions.  \n",
    "- **Memory**: Lightweight `ConversationBufferMemory` to hold short-term interaction history.  \n",
    "- **RAG Chain**: LangChain `ConversationalRetrievalChain` to combine context, memory, and the LLM response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**InterviewRAG** demonstrates how Retrieval-Augmented Generation, prompt engineering, and memory can be combined with local models to build a smart, cost-effective, and personalized interview prep assistant."
